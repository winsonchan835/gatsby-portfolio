A 3D driving simulation which utilizes user voice commands to control vehicle movement. This application was built with React, Three.JS, and utilizes Firebase on the backend. Using a pre-determined set of voice commands, a user guides a vehicle through a simulated city, attempting to arrive at the finish line as quick as possible.
